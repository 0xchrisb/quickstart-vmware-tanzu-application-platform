image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans either two or three Availability Zones.
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.
** In one public subnet, a Linux Bootstrap EC2 instance to allow Secure Shell (SSH) access to the Amazon Kubernetes Service node group in public and private subnets.
** An Amazon EKS cluster, which creates the Kubernetes control plane.
* In the private subnets a group of Kubernetes nodes.
* 4 Elastic Container Registry repositories to be used by Tanzu Application Platform.
* S3 bucket to be used for encrypted storage of configuration files.
* Using the Bootstrap VM (EC2) the Tanzu Application Platform will automatically be deployed into the EKS cluster.
