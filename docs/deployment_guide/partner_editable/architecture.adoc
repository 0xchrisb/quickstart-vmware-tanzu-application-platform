.Quick Start architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans either two or three Availability Zones.
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.
** In one public subnet:
*** An Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute (Amazon EC2) Linux instance that is used for bootstraping the installation of {partner-product-name} in an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) cluster, and also serves as a bastion host for administrators.
*** An Amazon EC2 Windows instance that is used as a bastion host for end users to access the {partner-product-short-name} website graphical user interface (GUI).
* In the private subnets:
** A group of Amazon EKS nodes in an Auto Scaling Group with Contour Envoy ingress controller pods and the {partner-product-short-name} installation.
   For a complete list of the {partner-product-short-name} packages, please see the https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Platform/1.1/tap/GUID-install-components.html#verify-the-installed-packages-1[documentation].
** 2 Classic Load Balancers attached to the private subnets.
   Both load balancers direct traffic to the Contour Envoy pod configured as a Kubernetes object.
   The Contour Envoy container provides both ingress and reverse proxy for the {partner-product-short-name} pods.
*** 1 load balancer is used for the {partner-product-short-name} website GUI.
*** 1 load balancer is used for the {partner-product-short-name} Supply Chain Security Tools metadata store.
* Amazon EKS for creating the Kubernetes control plane cluster that runs {partner-product-short-name}, Contour Envoy, and other containerized applications.
* An Amazon Route 53 private hosted zone used by the {partner-product-short-name} website GUI.
* 5 Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) private repositories.
** 3 are used for the installation of {partner-product-name}.
** 2 are used for the installation of the sample workload.
* AWS Secrets Manager for securely storing the {partner-registry} credentials for the {partner-product-short-name} cluster.
* Amazon CloudWatch for storing the Linux bastion host's performance metrics and {partner-product-short-name} bootstrap logs sent via the CloudWatch agent.
