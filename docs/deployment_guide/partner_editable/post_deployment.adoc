== Postdeployment steps

After you successfully deploy this Quick Start, confirm that your resources and services are updated and configured — including any required patches — to meet your security and other needs.
For more information, see the https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/[AWS Shared Responsibility Model].

=== Access the GUI

The {partner-product-name} website graphical user interface (GUI) can be accessed via the Amazon EC2 Windows bastion host instance that is deployed into one of the public subnets.
Retrieve the password for the Windows bastion host instance using https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/retrieve-windows-admin-password/[this guide], and then connect to it using https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/connecting_to_windows_instance.html[this guide].
The Windows bastion host is intended for users to access the {partner-product-short-name} URL provided within the Outputs tab of the CloudFormation deployment, once the {partner-product-short-name} installation is complete.
The {partner-product-name} GUI is not available via a public URL, but you can connect a Site to Site VPN or AWS Direct Connect to the VPC to allow for direct access from your enterprise network.
