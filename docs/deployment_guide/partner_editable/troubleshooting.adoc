*It's been more than 4 minutes, but the administrator password still isn't available for the Windows bastion host instance*

Verify that the Amazon EC2 Key Pair selected for the deployment is of type RSA, not ED25519.
As of June 23rd, 2022, Amazon EC2 Windows instances do not yet support ED25519 keys (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html[reference]).
If a Key Pair of type ED25519 is selected for this deployment, the CloudFormation stack will still deploy successfully, but you will not be able to retrieve the Windows bastion host's automatically generated password.

Options include:

. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/ResettingAdminPassword_EC2Launchv2.html[Reset the Windows administrator password using EC2 Launch v2]
. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-direct.html[Update the CloudFormation stack] to use a Key Pair with the supported type: RSA.
  Implementing this option requires replacing all Amazon EC2 instances that use this key, which includes both the Windows and Linux bastion hosts, as well as the EKS nodes (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-ec2-instance.html#cfn-ec2-instance-keyname[reference]).
. Customize the CloudFormation template to use a separate Key Pair for the Windows bastion host and then update the CloudFormation stack.
  Implementing this option will only replace the Windows bastion host instance.
  Instructions for implementing this are beyond the scope of this guide.
